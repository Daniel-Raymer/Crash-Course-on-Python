# Crash-Course-on-Python
The work I produced for the 1st Course in the Google IT Automation series

Please direct yourself to the final project folder in week 6.
This folder demonstates my understanding of Object Oriented Programming,
the course merely required a functional programming approach but I decided
to try and flex my understanding and made an OOP version too.
