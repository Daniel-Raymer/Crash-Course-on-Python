# Crash-Course-on-Python
My work for the Google course hosted on Coursera

Please direct yourself to the final project folder in week 6.
This folder demonstates my understanding of Object Oriented Programming,
the course merely required a functional programming approach but I decided
to try and flex my understanding and made and OOB version too.
